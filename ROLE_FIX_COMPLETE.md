# ✅ User Role Fix - Complete!

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

Your user HAD the superadmin role in the database ✅  
BUT the frontend didn't know about it ❌

**Why?**
- Backend wasn't including `role` in the JWT token
- Frontend wasn't extracting `role` from the JWT
- Sidebar was checking `user.role` but it was always `undefined`

---

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Backend (`auth.js`):**
```javascript
// After assigning superadmin role, GET it from database
const roleResult = await db.query(`
  SELECT role FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = $1 LIMIT 1
`, [user.id])

// Include role in JWT token
const jwtToken = jwt.sign({ 
  userId: user.id,
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email,
  role: userRole  // ← ADDED THIS
}, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '30d' })
```

### **2. Frontend (`GitHubCallback.tsx`):**
```javascript
// Extract role from JWT payload
const user = {
  id: payload.userId,
  name: payload.name,
  email: payload.email,
  avatarUrl: payload.avatarUrl,
  role: payload.role || 'user'  // ← ADDED THIS
}
```

## 🚀 **Deployed:**

**Backend:** Railway (auto-deploying now)  
**Frontend:** Vercel (auto-deploying now)

**Wait ~2-3 minutes** for both to deploy.

---

## 🧪 **Test Now:**

1. **Logout** from the app (clear your session)
2. **Login again** with GitHub (`rokas2025`)
3. **Check the sidebar** - you should now see:
   - ✅ "My Projects"
   - ✅ "User Management" (superadmin only)

---

## 📊 **What Happens:**

1. You login with GitHub
2. Backend assigns superadmin role to `rokas2025`
3. Backend queries database for your role
4. Backend puts `role: 'superadmin'` in JWT token
5. Frontend decodes JWT and saves `role` to user object
6. Sidebar checks `user.role === 'superadmin'`
7. ✅ "User Management" appears!

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployments
2. **Logout and login again** (to get new JWT with role)
3. You'll see all superadmin features! 🎉

---

**Important:** You MUST logout and login again to get the new JWT token with the role included!
