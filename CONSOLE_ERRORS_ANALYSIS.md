## ❌ **Frontend Console Errors**

### Error 1: Backend URL Analysis Failed (500)
```
Backend URL analysis failed: Request failed with status code 500
```

**Cause**: 
- Authentication missing or invalid
- User not logged in when trying to analyze URL
- URL analysis endpoint requires valid JWT token

**Solution**:
1. **User must log in first** before analyzing URLs
2. Check if JWT token is being sent in requests
3. Verify authentication middleware is working

**Test**:
```javascript
// Frontend should include auth token:
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
}
```

### Error 2: Failed to Load Repositories
```
Failed to load repositories: Error: Authentication failed
```

**Cause**:
- GitHub Personal Access Token missing or invalid
- Token not configured in environment variables
- User's GitHub account not connected

**Solutions**:

**Option A: Configure GitHub Token (Backend)**
```bash
# Add to Railway environment variables
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

**Option B: User Authentication (Frontend)**
- User needs to connect GitHub account
- OAuth flow must complete successfully
- GitHub token stored in user profile

**Check**:
```powershell
# Verify token is set
railway variables | Select-String "GITHUB"
```

## 🔧 **Fixes Needed**

### Priority 1: GitHub Token

**Problem**: Repository loading fails
**Fix**: Add GitHub Personal Access Token

**Steps**:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Create new token with `repo` scope
3. Add to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway variables set GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_your_token
   ```
4. Restart backend

---

### Priority 2: User Authentication Flow

**Problem**: Users getting 500/401 errors
**Fix**: Ensure proper authentication

**Frontend Checklist**:
- [ ] Login page working
- [ ] JWT token stored after login
- [ ] Token included in API requests
- [ ] Token refresh logic working
- [ ] Logout clears token

**Backend Checklist**:
- [x] Auth middleware working
- [x] JWT verification working
- [x] Database connected
- [ ] GitHub token configured

---

### Priority 3: Error Handling

**Problem**: 500 errors not user-friendly
**Fix**: Better error messages

**Improvements Needed**:
```javascript
// Instead of generic 500 error:
{
  error: "Request failed with status code 500"
}

// Return specific error:
{
  success: false,
  error: "Authentication required",
  message: "Please log in to analyze URLs",
  code: "AUTH_REQUIRED"
}
```
