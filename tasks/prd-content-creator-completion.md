# Product Requirements Document: Content Creator Module Completion

## Introduction/Overview

Complete the Content Creator module implementation within the CodeAnalyst platform to enable AI-powered content generation for business owners. The module allows users to create professional website content (About Us, Services, Products, etc.) using GPT-4-turbo with minimal input, preview the results, and export in various formats. This addresses the core problem of time-intensive and expensive content creation for small businesses.

2. **AI Content Generation**: Enable high-quality content generation using GPT-4-turbo with customizable settings
3. **User-Friendly Experience**: Maintain the existing clean 5-step UI flow while adding functional components
4. **Content Management**: Store generated content in database for user history and re-editing
5. **WordPress Integration**: Prepare foundation for future WordPress plugin/export capabilities
6. **Production Ready**: Deploy working module to Railway/Vercel through GitHub

2. **SettingsPanel Component**: AI generation settings (temperature, tone, style, length)
3. **ContentPreview Component**: Real-time preview with editing capabilities
4. **ExportOptions Component**: Multiple export formats (HTML, Text, Markdown)

### FR2: Backend API Implementation
1. **Content Generation Endpoint**: `/api/content-creator/generate` with GPT-4-turbo integration
2. **Content Storage**: Store generated content in PostgreSQL with user association
3. **Content History**: `/api/content-creator/history` endpoint for user's past generations
4. **Template Management**: Enhanced template system with proper database storage

### FR3: AI Integration

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Develop optimized prompts for each template type
3. **Settings Control**: Temperature (0.1-0.9), tone options, style variations
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with user feedback

### FR4: Database Schema
1. **content_templates table**: Store template definitions and input field configurations
2. **generated_content table**: Store user's generated content with metadata
3. **user_content_settings table**: Store user preferences for AI generation

### FR5: Content Management
1. **Save/Load Content**: Users can save generated content and reload for editing
2. **Version History**: Track multiple versions of the same content piece

2. **Image Generation**: No AI image creation (text content only)
3. **Multi-language Support**: English only for initial version
4. **Collaborative Features**: No team collaboration or approval workflows
5. **Advanced SEO Tools**: Basic structure only, no advanced SEO optimization
6. **Custom Template Creation**: Use predefined templates only
7. **Real-time Collaboration**: Single user editing only

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Maintain Existing Design**: Keep current 5-step process and visual styling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Replace "Coming Soon" placeholders with functional components
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all new components work on mobile/tablet
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during content generation (15-30 seconds)
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages with retry options

### Component Integration
- **TemplateSelector**: Already implemented, may need minor enhancements
- **Step Navigation**: Keep existing step progression logic
- **State Management**: Use existing Zustand store pattern
- **Icon Consistency**: Use existing Heroicons throughout

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Architecture
- **Existing OpenAI Service**: Leverage current AIAnalysisService.js patterns
- **Database**: Use existing Supabase PostgreSQL connection
- **Authentication**: Integrate with existing auth middleware
- **Error Handling**: Follow established error response patterns

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Components**: Follow existing component structure in `src/pages/modules/`
- **TypeScript**: Maintain type safety with existing patterns
- **State Management**: Extend existing `contentCreatorStore.ts`
- **API Integration**: Use existing service patterns from `contentCreatorService.ts`

### AI Integration
- **Model Selection**: Use GPT-4-turbo (already configured in system)
- **Prompt Templates**: Create modular prompt system for different content types
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper rate limiting for API calls
- **Cost Control**: Token counting and usage tracking

### Database Considerations
- **Migration Scripts**: Create proper database migrations for new tables
- **Indexing**: Add appropriate indexes for content lookup and user queries
- **Data Retention**: Consider content cleanup policies for storage management

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption
- **Completion Rate**: 80% of users who start template selection complete content generation

- **Time Savings**: Average content creation time under 10 minutes (vs 2+ hours manual)

### Technical Performance
- **Generation Speed**: Content generation completes within 30 seconds
- **System Reliability**: 99% uptime for content generation API
- **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of generation attempts fail

### Business Impact

- **User Retention**: Users who generate content have 40% higher platform retention

## Open Questions

1. **Content Length Limits**: What are reasonable word count limits for different template types?
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Should there be daily/hourly limits per user for content generation?
3. **Content Ownership**: How long should generated content be stored in the database?
4. **Template Expansion**: Which additional template types should be prioritized after MVP?
5. **Integration Testing**: What's the preferred approach for testing OpenAI integration in development?
6. **Deployment Approach**: Should this be deployed as a feature flag initially?
7. **User Onboarding**: Do we need a tutorial or guide for first-time users?
8. **Content Backup**: Should users be able to export their entire content history?
