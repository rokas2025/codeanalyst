# ⚠️ **URGENT: Database Fix Required Before Testing**

## 🔴 **CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**

Before the analysis will work, you **MUST** run this SQL in Supabase:

### **Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run This:**

```sql
-- Fix the missing updated_at column
ALTER TABLE code_analyses 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE code_analyses 
SET updated_at = COALESCE(completed_at, created_at);

-- Verify it worked
SELECT id, status, progress, created_at, updated_at 
FROM code_analyses 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed (Code)**

### **1. Database Connection Keepalive** ✅
**File**: `backend/src/database/connection.js`

Added:
```javascript
keepAlive: true,
keepAliveInitialDelayMillis: 10000, // Send keepalive every 10 seconds
statement_timeout: 300000, // 5 minutes max per query
query_timeout: 300000 // 5 minutes max
```

**Why**: Prevents Supabase from terminating connections during long-running analysis.

---

### **2. Increased Frontend Timeout** ✅
**File**: `src/services/analysisService.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE: 60 attempts = 10 minutes
const maxAttempts = 60

// AFTER: 120 attempts = 20 minutes
const maxAttempts = 120
```

**Why**: Complex repository analysis can take 10-15 minutes.

## 🐛 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **What Happened:**
1. ❌ Analysis started → Backend tried to update `code_analyses` table
2. ❌ PostgreSQL trigger tried to set `updated_at` column **that doesn't exist**
3. ❌ Error: `record "new" has no field "updated_at"`
4. ❌ Backend crashed with `uncaughtException`
5. ❌ Database connection terminated: `{:shutdown, :db_termination}`
6. ❌ Frontend kept polling but got stuck at 0% forever
7. ❌ After 10 minutes: `Analysis timeout`

### **Why It Happened:**
- The database schema migration didn't add `updated_at` to `code_analyses` table
- But a trigger `update_code_analyses_updated_at` was created expecting it
- Every UPDATE query triggered the error

---

## 🎯 **Testing Instructions**

### **After Running the SQL Fix:**

1. **Wait for Railway deployment** (auto-deploys when you pushed)
2. **Clear any failed analyses**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE code_analyses 
   SET status = 'cancelled' 
   WHERE status = 'failed' OR status = 'analyzing';
   ```

3. **Test the analysis**:
   - Go to Code Analyst module
   - Select a **small repository** (< 100 files)
   - Click "Analyze"
   - **Watch for progress**: Should show 5% → 15% → 30% → 60% → 90% → 100%

4. **Monitor Railway logs**:
   - Should see progress updates
   - Should NOT see `db_termination` errors
   - Should NOT see `updated_at` errors

---

## 📊 **Expected Progress Flow**

```
Starting... → 5% → 15% → 30% → 60% → 90% → 100% → Complete!
    ↓         ↓      ↓      ↓      ↓      ↓       ↓
  Initial   Setup  Fetch  Analyze  AI   Store  Done
```

**Timing**:
- Small repos (< 50 files): 2-5 minutes
- Medium repos (50-200 files): 5-10 minutes  
- Large repos (200+ files): 10-20 minutes

## 🔍 **How to Verify the Fix Worked**

### **Check 1: Database Column Exists**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'code_analyses' AND column_name = 'updated_at';
```
**Expected**: Returns 1 row with `updated_at | timestamp with time zone`

### **Check 2: Trigger Works**
```sql
-- Find a test record
SELECT id, progress, updated_at FROM code_analyses LIMIT 1;

-- Update it
UPDATE code_analyses SET progress = progress + 1 WHERE id = '<id_from_above>';

-- Check if updated_at changed
SELECT id, progress, updated_at FROM code_analyses WHERE id = '<id_from_above>';
```
**Expected**: `updated_at` timestamp should be more recent after UPDATE

### **Check 3: Analysis Completes**
- Start analysis
- Watch Railway logs: No `updated_at` errors
- Frontend shows incremental progress
- Analysis reaches 100%

## 🚨 **If Still Failing**

### **Check Railway Logs For:**

✅ **Good Sign**:
```
🤖 Starting PREMIUM AI analysis: <uuid>
📡 Repository content fetched: X files
✅ Analysis completed successfully
```

❌ **Bad Sign**:
```
error: record "new" has no field "updated_at"
uncaughtException: {:shutdown, :db_termination}
```

### **If You See Bad Signs:**

1. **Verify SQL ran successfully** in Supabase
2. **Check if column exists**: 
   ```sql
   \d code_analyses
   ```
3. **Restart Railway service**: Settings → Restart

---

## 📝 **Summary**

### **What You Need to Do:**
1. ✅ **RUN THE SQL** in Supabase (see top of this file)
2. ✅ **Wait** for Railway to deploy (already pushed)
3. ✅ **Test** a small repository analysis
4. ✅ **Verify** progress shows real percentages (not stuck at 0%)

### **What's Already Done:**
- ✅ Backend: Added connection keepalive
- ✅ Backend: Increased query timeout
- ✅ Frontend: Increased polling timeout (20 minutes)
- ✅ Deployed to GitHub/Railway

**Ready to test once you run the SQL fix!** 🚀
