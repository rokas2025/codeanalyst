# 🎉 Development Environment Setup - Almost Complete!

## ✅ **What's Done:**

1. ✅ **Railway Development Service Created**
   - Service: `web` (ID: `34acccef-54a8-419a-8673-ee86a8caf4f4`)
   - Branch: `develop`
   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Start Command: `npm start`

2. ✅ **Environment Variables Configured**
   - All production variables copied
   - Development-specific values set:
     - `NODE_ENV=development`
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liRkiQaCMrZxlYPM`
     - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=688e3bc5d899f8bdeda1f07e07f89a0e6e129fae`
     - `FRONTEND_URL=https://codeanalyst-git-develop-rokas-projects-bff726e7.vercel.app`

3. ✅ **Railway is Redeploying**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
   - The app should start successfully this time!

## 📋 **Next Steps (After Deployment Completes):**

### **Step 1: Get Your Railway Development URL**

Once Railway finishes deploying:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your **development service** (`web`)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Networking** → **Public Networking**
4. Click **"Generate Domain"** if not already generated
5. Copy the URL (will look like: `https://web-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

---

### **Step 2: Update GitHub OAuth Callback**

Update one more variable in Railway:

```bash
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=https://[your-railway-dev-url]/api/auth/github/callback
```

Replace `[your-railway-dev-url]` with the actual URL from Step 1.

### **Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variables**

Go to Vercel Dashboard and add environment variable for **Preview (develop branch)**:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/rokas-projects-bff726e7/codeanalyst/settings/environment-variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://[your-railway-dev-url]` (from Step 1)
   - **Environment**: ✅ **Preview** (select only Preview, not Production)
3. Click **"Save"**
4. Redeploy the `develop` branch preview

## 🔍 **How to Check If It's Working:**

### **1. Check Railway Deployment:**
```
Go to Railway → Development Service → Deployments
Should see: "Server listening on port 3001"
```

### **2. Check Railway Logs:**
```
Should see:
✅ Connected to database
✅ Server listening on port 3001
✅ All AI services initialized
```

### **3. Test the Development URL:**
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://[your-railway-dev-url]/health

# Should return:
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

---

## 🎯 **Final Architecture:**

```
PRODUCTION:
├─ Vercel: https://app.beenex.dev (main branch)
└─ Railway: https://[prod-railway-url] (main branch)

DEVELOPMENT:
├─ Vercel: https://codeanalyst-git-develop-rokas-projects-bff726e7.vercel.app (develop branch)
└─ Railway: https://[dev-railway-url] (develop branch)
```

---

## 🚀 **Testing Your Development Setup:**

Once everything is configured:

1. **Open your development frontend:**
   ```
   https://codeanalyst-git-develop-rokas-projects-bff726e7.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Try GitHub OAuth login**
   - Should work without redirecting to production

3. **Try analyzing a repository**
   - Should use the development backend

## 📝 **What to Share Next:**

Please share:
1. **Railway development URL** (from Settings → Networking)
2. **Deployment status** (Success/Failed)
3. **Any errors in Railway logs** (if deployment failed)

Then I'll help you complete the Vercel configuration! 🎉
