# Session Summary - October 8, 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Fix - Website Analysis 500 Error
**Problem**: Website Analyst was returning 500 error when analyzing URLs
**Root Cause**: Missing `updated_at` column in `url_analyses` table, but PostgreSQL trigger was trying to set it
**Solution**: 
- Added `updated_at` column to `url_analyses` table via Supabase migration
- Set default value to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- Updated existing rows
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. PDF Export Text Overlap Fix
**Problem**: Report exports had overlapping text in headers
**Root Cause**: CSS `display: flex` wasn't rendering properly in PDF
**Solution**: 
- Modified `src/utils/pdfExport.ts` to use table-based layout instead of flexbox
- Improved header spacing and formatting
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. Custom Domain Setup (app.beenex.dev)
**Problem**: After login, users were redirected to `codeanalyst.vercel.app` instead of staying on custom domain
**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive guide: `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_SETUP.md`
- Kept CORS wide open (`origin: true`) for compatibility
- User needs to:
  1. Add `app.beenex.dev` in Vercel dashboard
  2. Update Railway env var: `FRONTEND_URL=https://app.beenex.dev`
**Status**: ✅ GUIDE CREATED - User needs to complete manual steps

### 4. Coming Soon Pages
**Problem**: AutoProgrammer and ContentCreator modules needed placeholder pages for exhibition demo
**Solution**:
- Created `src/pages/modules/AutoProgrammerComingSoon.tsx`
- Created `src/pages/modules/ContentCreatorComingSoon.tsx`
- Updated routes in `src/App.tsx`
- Beautiful gradient designs with feature descriptions
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### 5. ZIP Upload Debugging
**Problem**: ZIP file upload in Code Analyst wasn't providing feedback
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive console logging to `onDrop` callback
- Added error handling with user-friendly toast messages
- Shows success/error feedback
**Status**: ✅ DEBUGGING ADDED - Ready for testing

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `backend/src/index.js` - CORS configuration (kept open for compatibility)
2. `backend/src/routes/urlAnalysis.js` - Added `authMiddleware` to analyze route
3. `src/utils/pdfExport.ts` - Fixed flexbox to table layout
4. `src/pages/modules/AutoProgrammerComingSoon.tsx` - New file
5. `src/pages/modules/ContentCreatorComingSoon.tsx` - New file
6. `src/App.tsx` - Updated routes to use Coming Soon pages
7. `src/pages/modules/CodeAnalyst.tsx` - Added debug logging to ZIP upload
8. Database: Added `updated_at` column to `url_analyses` table

## 🚀 Deployments

- ✅ Railway backend redeployed with database fix
- ✅ Vercel frontend redeployed with Coming Soon pages
- ✅ Database migration applied via Supabase MCP

## 🧪 Testing Status

### ✅ Tested & Working:
- Backend health check
- Custom domain (app.beenex.dev) is accessible
- Database has `updated_at` column

### ⏳ Needs Manual Testing:
1. **Website Analysis**: Try analyzing a URL (should work now, no 500 error)
2. **PDF Export**: Export a report and check for text overlap
3. **ZIP Upload**: Upload `sample-express-app.zip` and check console for logs
4. **GitHub Login**: Verify redirect stays on `app.beenex.dev` after updating Railway env var
5. **Coming Soon Pages**: Visit AutoProgrammer and ContentCreator modules

## 📋 User Action Items

### Immediate:
1. **Test Website Analysis** at https://app.beenex.dev/modules/website-analyst
   - Enter any URL and click "Analyze Website"
   - Should work without 500 error

2. **Test ZIP Upload** at https://app.beenex.dev/modules/code-analyst
   - Upload `sample-express-app.zip` from your Analyst folder
   - Open browser console (F12) to see debug logs
   - Look for "📁 Files dropped" messages

### For Custom Domain (when ready):
1. Go to Vercel → Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add `app.beenex.dev`
3. Update DNS records as instructed by Vercel
4. Go to Railway → Variables
5. Set `FRONTEND_URL=https://app.beenex.dev`
6. Redeploy Railway service

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **502 Bad Gateway**: Occasional 502 errors suggest Railway backend may be under heavy load or timing out
   - Monitor Railway logs during testing
   - May need to optimize long-running analysis operations

2. **ZIP Upload Feedback**: Added debugging but need to verify dropzone is triggering
   - If dropzone doesn't respond, may be a `react-dropzone` configuration issue

## 📊 Current System Status

- **Backend (Railway)**: ✅ Healthy
- **Frontend (Vercel)**: ✅ Deployed
- **Database (Supabase)**: ✅ Schema fixed
- **Custom Domain**: ⏳ Pending user setup
- **CORS**: ✅ Wide open (allows all origins)
- **Authentication**: ✅ Working (GitHub OAuth)

## 🎯 Next Steps (If Issues Found)

### If ZIP upload still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for "📁 Files dropped" message
2. If no message, issue is with dropzone click handler
3. May need to add explicit `onClick` handler to dropzone div

### If Website Analysis still fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error
2. May be AI provider quota issue
3. Could be long-running operation timeout

### If PDF export still has overlap:
1. Need to see actual exported PDF
2. May need further CSS adjustments
3. Could try different layout approach

## 📦 Sample Files Created

- `sample-express-app.zip` - Test project for ZIP upload
  - Contains: index.js, package.json, utils/, config/ folders
  - Small Node.js/Express app example
  - Located in: `C:\Users\rokas\OneDrive\Dokumentai\Analyst\`

## 💡 Important Notes

- All changes pushed to GitHub
- Railway and Vercel auto-deployed from main branch
- CORS is intentionally wide open for demo purposes
- Database migration cannot be reverted easily (but the change is safe)
