= Can I disconnect my site? =

Absolutely. You can disconnect your site at any time from the plugin settings page.

No problem! The next sync will automatically update your theme information in CodeAnalyst.

Yes, but the CodeAnalyst platform needs to be able to reach your site via HTTPS. You may need to use a tunneling service like ngrok for local development.
