# 🐛 Bug Fixed! - Duplicate LanguageDetector

## Issue Found ❌

**Error**: `SyntaxError: Identifier 'LanguageDetector' has already been declared`

**Location**: `backend/src/routes/contentAnalysis.js` lines 482 and 544

**Cause**: The `LanguageDetector` was imported and instantiated twice in the same function scope:
- Line 482: First import (correct)
- Line 544: Duplicate import (bug)

## Fix Applied ✅

Removed the duplicate import at line 544. The language is now detected once at line 482 and reused throughout the function.

**Commit**: `bcf22f6` - "Fix: Remove duplicate LanguageDetector declaration in contentAnalysis.js"

## Deployment Status

🟡 **Railway is deploying now** with the fix
