# 🚂 Railway Login Process

## ✅ **What I Did:**
1. Opened Railway login in your browser
2. Started Railway CLI login process

## 👉 **What You Need To Do:**

### **In Your Browser:**
1. You should see a Railway login/authorization page
2. **Authorize the CLI access**
3. You might need to enter the pairing code: `orchid-stunning-dream`

### **After You Authorize:**
Just tell me **"authorized"** or **"done"** and I'll continue!

## 🔍 **Alternative: Manual URL Sharing**

If the Railway CLI login is giving you trouble, you can also just:

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your **"web"** service (the development one)
3. Copy the URL from Settings → Networking
4. Paste it here

And I'll configure everything for you!

## 📊 **What We're Trying to Get:**

We need your Railway development backend URL, which looks like:
```
https://web-production-XXXX.up.railway.app
```

Once we have this, I'll:
- ✅ Configure Vercel to use this URL
- ✅ Update Railway with the correct GitHub callback URL
- ✅ Fix the GitHub OAuth login issue

**Let me know when you've authorized Railway or share the URL directly!** 🚀
