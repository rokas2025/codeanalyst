# Plugin Download Fix ✅

## Issue
Plugin download was failing with error: "Failed to download plugin"

## Root Cause
The plugin ZIP file (`codeanalyst-connector.zip`) was only in the project root directory, but Railway deployment runs from the `backend` directory. The backend couldn't find the file.

## Solution

### 1. Improved Path Resolution
Updated `backend/src/routes/wordpress.js` to check multiple possible paths:
- `../../../codeanalyst-connector.zip` (project root - development)
- `../../codeanalyst-connector.zip` (backend parent)
- `process.cwd()/codeanalyst-connector.zip` (current working directory - Railway)
- `process.cwd()/backend/codeanalyst-connector.zip` (backend subdirectory)

### 2. Added ZIP to Backend Directory
Copied `codeanalyst-connector.zip` to `backend/` directory so it gets deployed with Railway.

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed logging to show:
- Which paths were tried
- Current working directory
- __dirname value
- Where the file was found (or not found)

## Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/routes/wordpress.js` - Improved path resolution and error handling

**Files Added:**
- `backend/codeanalyst-connector.zip` - Plugin ZIP in backend directory for deployment

## Testing

After Railway deployment completes (2-3 minutes):

1. Go to https://app.beenex.dev/connected-sites
2. Click "Download Plugin" button
3. Verify `codeanalyst-connector.zip` downloads successfully (13.87 KB)

## Status

✅ **Fixed and Deployed**
- Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Railway auto-deployment in progress
- Should be live in 2-3 minutes

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Deployment** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Test Download** - Try downloading the plugin again
3. **Verify** - Check that the ZIP file downloads correctly

If the issue persists after deployment, check Railway logs for the error details.
