# 🔧 WordPress Plugin Activation Error - Complete Fix Guide

## 📋 **Current Situation:**
- Plugin ZIP uploads successfully
- Gets "folder already exists" warning
- Activation fails with "fatal error"
- No specific error details visible

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Get the Actual Error First**

### **Step 1: Enable WordPress Debug Mode**

**Edit your `wp-config.php` file:**

Find this line:
```php
/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */
```

**Add ABOVE that line:**
```php
// Enable Debug Mode
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
@ini_set('display_errors', 0);
```

### **Step 2: Manually Delete Old Plugin Files**

**Via cPanel File Manager or FTP:**

1. Navigate to: `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Find `codeanalyst-connector` folder
3. **DELETE the entire folder**
4. Confirm it's completely gone

**Via SSH (if you have access):**
```bash
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
rm -rf codeanalyst-connector
ls | grep codeanalyst  # Should show nothing
```

### **Step 3: Upload Fresh Copy**

1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New
2. Click "Upload Plugin"
3. Choose `codeanalyst-connector.zip`
4. Click "Install Now"
5. **DO NOT activate yet!**

### **Step 4: Try to Activate & Check Logs**

1. Click "Activate Plugin"
2. If it fails, immediately go to your file manager
3. Navigate to: `/wp-content/debug.log`
4. Open the file and copy the **last 20-30 lines**
5. **Share those lines with me**

---

## 🔍 **What We're Looking For:**

The debug.log will show something like:

```
[16-Oct-2025 12:00:00 UTC] PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'Something' not found in /wp-content/plugins/codeanalyst-connector/includes/file-reader.php:34
```

This tells us:
- **What** the error is
- **Which file** has the problem
- **Which line** number

## 🛠️ **Common Fixes (Try These While Waiting):**

### **Fix 1: Check PHP Version**

**Minimum Required:** PHP 7.4+

**Check your PHP version:**
- WordPress Admin → Dashboard → Site Health → Info → Server
- Look for "PHP Version"

**If below 7.4:**
- Contact your host to upgrade PHP
- Or try a compatibility fix (I can help with this)

### **Fix 2: Check Folder Structure After Upload**

After uploading, the structure should be:

```
/wp-content/plugins/
└── codeanalyst-connector/              ← Main folder
    ├── codeanalyst-connector.php       ← Main plugin file
    ├── admin/
    │   ├── settings-page.php
    │   └── css/
    │       └── admin-styles.css
    └── includes/
        ├── api-client.php
        └── file-reader.php
```

**NOT like this (wrong):**
```
/wp-content/plugins/
└── codeanalyst-connector/
    └── codeanalyst-connector/          ← DOUBLE NESTING (BAD!)
        ├── codeanalyst-connector.php
        └── ...
```

### **Fix 3: Check File Permissions**

Files should be:
- **Folders:** 755
- **Files:** 644

**Fix via SSH:**
```bash
cd /wp-content/plugins/codeanalyst-connector
find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

### **Fix 4: Test PHP Syntax Locally**

If you have PHP installed locally:

```bash
cd wordpress-plugin
php -l codeanalyst-connector.php
php -l admin/settings-page.php
php -l includes/api-client.php
php -l includes/file-reader.php
```

This will show any PHP syntax errors.

## 📝 **Alternative: Test with WordPress CLI**

If your host has WP-CLI:

```bash
# List plugins
wp plugin list

# Try to activate with verbose output
wp plugin activate codeanalyst-connector --debug
```

This will show the exact error.
