# front-end-feature

You are working on the CodeAnalyst frontend (React + TypeScript strict, Vite, Tailwind, Zustand, alias @/ → ./src).

I want to implement or fix a FRONTEND feature.

Please follow this template:

1. Ask me which module/page we are touching (under src/pages/modules/**) and which files to open.
2. Only use src/pages/modules/**, src/services/**, src/components/**, src/stores/**, src/utils/**, src/types/** unless I say otherwise.
3. Make small, incremental changes and avoid touching unrelated modules.
4. After you propose changes, summarize:
   - Files modified
   - Short description per file
5. Commands must be PowerShell-compatible if you suggest any.

Now ask me for:
- Module name
- File path(s)
- Short description of what I want.
