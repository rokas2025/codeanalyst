CodeAnalyst session notes convention:

- When the conversation has covered a full feature, multiple bugfixes, or is getting long, you should:
  1) Create a concise session summary, and
  2) Suggest writing it into: docs/SESSION_NOTES.md (or docs/session-notes/<date>-<topic>.md)

The summary should include:
- Title with date and topic, e.g. "2025-11-20 – WebsiteAnalyst module updates"
- Goals for this session
- Key decisions (APIs, architecture choices, auth implications, etc.)
- Files touched, with short notes (e.g. src/pages/modules/WebsiteAnalyst/index.tsx – added UI for X)
- PowerShell commands used to run dev servers/tests
- TODO list / next steps

After generating the summary, tell me explicitly:
- That the chat is now a good point to close
- That I should open a new chat for the next chunk of work
- That I should paste this summary or at least the TODO section as the starting context of the new chat.

Never rely solely on the old chat history when continuing work in a new chat; always base continuation on the written summary.
