## Monitoring

### Check Deployment Status
- **Vercel (Frontend):** https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Railway (Backend):** https://railway.app/dashboard

### Check Logs
```bash
# Backend logs (Railway)
railway logs

# Or check in Railway dashboard
```

### Check Frontend Build
- Vercel will show build status in dashboard
- Check for any build errors or warnings

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found:

```bash
# 1. Revert the commit
git revert HEAD

# 2. Push the revert
git push origin main

# 3. Or reset to previous commit (if needed)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force  # Use with caution!
```

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- âœ… All builds complete without errors
- âœ… Frontend is accessible at production URL
- âœ… Backend is responding to API requests
- âœ… WordPress selections work in all three modules
- âœ… ZIP upload works in Auto Programmer
- âœ… Admin users see "My Projects" menu
- âœ… No console errors in browser
- âœ… No 500 errors in backend logs
