# ✅ SETUP COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Your Development Environment is Ready!

## ✨ What Just Happened

I've configured your **complete development workflow** with:

### 1. Git Branch Structure ✅
```
📦 Your Repository
├── 🟢 main (production) ← Safe, unchanged
└── 🔵 develop (staging) ← New, ready for work!
    └── 🟡 feature/* ← Create these as needed
```

### 2. Automatic Deployments ✅
- **Pushed to GitHub**: `develop` branch is live
- **Vercel is building**: Creating preview URL now (2-5 min)
- **Auto-deploy enabled**: Every push = new preview

### 3. Same Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ Railway backend (no changes needed)
- ✅ Database (same for all)
- ✅ API keys (same for all)
- ✅ Only difference: separate URLs per branch

---

## 🌐 Your URLs

### Production (main):
```
https://analyst-psi.vercel.app
```
Status: ✅ **Live and unchanged**

### Development (develop):
```
https://analyst-psi-git-develop-[team].vercel.app
```
Status: ⏳ **Building now** (check Vercel dashboard in 2-5 min)

### Feature Branches (future):
```
https://analyst-psi-git-[branch-name]-[team].vercel.app
```
Status: ✅ **Auto-created** when you push any branch
