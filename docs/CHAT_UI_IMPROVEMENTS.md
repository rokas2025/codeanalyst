# AI Chat UI Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the AI coding assistant chat interface to enhance user experience, readability, and professional appearance.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Message Rendering**
- **Library Integration**: Added `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, and `react-syntax-highlighter` for professional text rendering

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks now have proper syntax highlighting with VS Code Dark Plus theme

### 2. **Clickable File Links**
- **Smart File Detection**: Advanced regex patterns detect file paths across multiple formats:
  - Standard file paths (`src/components/File.tsx`)
  - Relative paths (`./components/File.tsx`)
  - Absolute paths (`C:\path\to\file.ext`)
  - Directory-based paths (`backend/api/routes.js`)

- **Color-Coded File Types**: Different file extensions have distinctive colors:
  - `.js/.jsx` - Yellow
  - `.ts/.tsx` - Blue
  - `.py` - Green
  - `.java` - Orange
  - `.cpp/.c` - Purple
  - `.css/.scss` - Pink
  - `.html` - Red
  - And many more...

- **Interactive Functionality**: 
  - Clicking file names attempts to open them in the preview panel
  - Hover effects for better UX
  - Toast notifications for feedback

- **Path Matching**: Intelligent matching against project file structure

#### Enhanced Code Blocks
- **Language Detection**: Automatic language detection for syntax highlighting
- **Language Labels**: Code blocks show the programming language
- **Professional Styling**: VS Code-inspired dark theme for code
- **Copy Functionality**: Easy to copy code snippets

## Technical Implementation
