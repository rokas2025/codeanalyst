## 🔄 **PENDING TASKS** (Next Session)

### 1. **Setup Automated Backup Scheduler** ⏰
**Action Required**: Run as Administrator
```powershell
# Open PowerShell as Administrator
cd C:\Users\rokas\OneDrive\Dokumentai\Analyst
.\scripts\setup-backup-scheduler.ps1 -RemoveExisting
```

**This Will**:
- Create Windows Task Scheduler entry
- Run backups every 6 hours automatically
- Backup on startup and daily at 2 AM

---

### 2. **Verify Deployment Status** 🚀
**Action Required**: Check if chat improvements are live

#### Check Railway (Backend):
```powershell
railway status
railway logs --tail
railway open
```

#### Check Vercel (Frontend):
- Visit Vercel dashboard
- Or check if auto-deployment is configured
- Test URL: https://your-app.vercel.app

#### Test Chat UI Improvements:
1. Open live application
2. Navigate to **AI Chat / AutoProgrammer** module
3. Verify:
   - ✨ Markdown rendering works
   - 🔗 File names are clickable and color-coded
   - 🎨 Professional styling is applied
   - 💬 Message bubbles look enhanced
   - ⌨️ Textarea auto-resizes

---

### 3. **Manual Backup Test** (Optional)
```powershell
# Test simple backup (works already)
.\scripts\simple-backup.ps1

# Test full backup
.\scripts\backup-local.ps1 -Verbose
.\scripts\backup-github.ps1 -Verbose
```

**Note**: Some PowerShell scripts have syntax issues that need fixing before full automation works

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)**

### High Priority:
1. **Verify Deployment** - Check if chat UI improvements are live
   ```powershell
   railway status
   railway open
   ```

2. **Test Live Application** - Verify chat UI works in production

3. **Setup Backup Automation** - Run scheduler setup as Admin
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\setup-backup-scheduler.ps1 -RemoveExisting
   ```

### Medium Priority:
4. **Fix PowerShell Scripts** - Some scripts have syntax issues
   - `backup-master.ps1` needs catch/finally blocks fixed
   - `test-backup.ps1` has parsing errors

5. **Test Full Backup Cycle** - Once scripts are fixed
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\backup-master.ps1 -Verbose
   ```

### Low Priority:
6. **Monitor Backup History** - After automation is running
   ```powershell
   Get-Content C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\backup_master.log -Tail 20
   ```

7. **Review Backup Reports** - Check backup success rate
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\backup-status.ps1
   ```

## 📝 **QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS**

### Railway Deployment:
```powershell
railway status          # Check status
railway logs           # View logs
railway open           # Open dashboard
railway ps             # Running services
```

### Git Operations:
```powershell
git status             # Check status
git log --oneline -5   # Recent commits
git push origin main   # Push changes
```

### Backup Operations:
```powershell
.\scripts\simple-backup.ps1              # Quick backup
.\scripts\backup-status.ps1              # Check status
Get-Content C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\*.log # View logs
```

---

## 🛡️ **BACKUP LOCATIONS**

- **Local Backups**: `C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\Local\`
- **Database Backups**: `C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\Database\`
- **Simple Backups**: `C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\Simple\`
- **Logs**: `C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\*.log`

## 🔗 **IMPORTANT LINKS**

- **Railway Project**: melodious-presence
- **API URL**: https://codeanalyst-production.up.railway.app/api
- **GitHub**: (your repository)

---

## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**

1. **PowerShell Script Errors**: Some backup scripts have syntax errors
   - Affects: `backup-master.ps1`, `test-backup.ps1`
   - Simple backup works fine
   - Fix needed before full automation

2. **Terminal Output**: Commands sometimes don't show output immediately
   - May need to press Enter
   - Windows PowerShell behavior

3. **Deployment Verification**: Need to confirm chat UI is live
   - Railway should auto-deploy
   - Vercel may need manual deployment

---

## 💡 **TIPS**

- Use `railway logs --tail` to watch real-time deployment
- Check `backup_history.log` to verify backups are running
- Run `.\scripts\backup-status.ps1` weekly to monitor backups
- Test restore process quarterly
- Keep at least 10 backup copies (automatic cleanup configured)

---

## 📞 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If Deployment Fails:
```powershell
railway logs                    # Check logs
railway status                  # Check status
railway variables              # Verify environment
```

### If Backup Fails:
```powershell
# Use simple backup
.\scripts\simple-backup.ps1

# Check logs
Get-Content C:\Backups\CodeAnalyst\backup_history.log -Tail 20
```

### If Railway CLI Issues:
```powershell
railway login                   # Re-authenticate
railway link                    # Re-link project
railway --version              # Check version
```

**Session Status**: ✅ Major improvements completed, pending deployment verification and backup automation setup

**Next Session**: Verify deployments, fix remaining PowerShell issues, and complete backup automation
