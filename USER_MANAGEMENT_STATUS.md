# User Management & Project System - Implementation Status

## 🎯 Current Status: **READY FOR DATABASE MIGRATION**

---

## ✅ Completed (2/17 tasks)

### 1. Database Schema Created
- ✅ SQL migration file: `backend/src/database/user-management-migration.sql`
- ✅ Clear history SQL: `backend/src/database/clear-analysis-history.sql`
- ✅ Migration runner scripts created (but can't execute complex SQL via Node.js)

### 2. Migration Instructions
- ✅ Created: `RUN_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- ✅ Simple copy-paste instructions for Supabase SQL Editor
- ✅ Direct link to your Supabase project

---

## ⏸️ WAITING FOR: Database Migration

**You need to run the SQL migration in Supabase** (takes 2 minutes):

1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ecwpwmsqanlatfntzoul/sql
2. Copy contents of: `backend/src/database/user-management-migration.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify superadmin created: rokas@zubas.lt
5. Run: `backend/src/database/clear-analysis-history.sql`
6. Tell me: "migration done" or "ready"

**Why I can't run it:**
- The SQL contains procedural blocks (DO $$) that Node.js pg client can't execute
- Supabase SQL Editor is designed for this
- It's actually faster to copy-paste than script it!

## 📋 Pending (15/17 tasks)

Once you run the migration, I'll implement:

### Backend (7 tasks)
1. ⏳ Role middleware (isSuperAdmin, isAdmin, hasProjectAccess, hasModuleAccess)
2. ⏳ Superadmin routes (user management API)
3. ⏳ Project routes (CRUD, invitations, permissions API)
4. ⏳ DatabaseService methods (user/project management)
5. ⏳ Update auth routes (registration approval, login checks)
6. ⏳ Fix analysis history privacy (filter by user_id)
7. ⏳ Update existing endpoints to check module permissions

### Frontend (6 tasks)
8. ⏳ ProjectContext (global project state)
9. ⏳ ProjectSelector component (header dropdown)
10. ⏳ Superadmin user management UI
11. ⏳ Admin project management UI
12. ⏳ ModuleAccessGuard component
13. ⏳ Update all analyst modules (grey out URL inputs in project mode)

### Testing (2 tasks)
14. ⏳ Test superadmin flows
15. ⏳ Test admin/user flows

## 🗂️ Files Created

### Database
- `backend/src/database/user-management-migration.sql` - Main migration
- `backend/src/database/clear-analysis-history.sql` - Privacy fix

### Scripts
- `run-user-management-migration.mjs` - Attempted Node.js runner (can't handle DO blocks)
- `run-clear-history.mjs` - Clear history runner

### Documentation
- `RUN_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - **READ THIS FIRST**

## 🎯 What The System Will Do

### For Superadmin (rokas@zubas.lt)
- ✅ View all users (admins + users)
- ✅ Activate/deactivate any user
- ✅ Create new superadmins
- ✅ View all projects from all admins
- ✅ Full system access

### For Admins (Clients)
- ✅ Register → Wait for superadmin approval
- ✅ Create projects (with URL)
- ✅ Invite users to projects
- ✅ Set module permissions per user
- ✅ Manage their projects
- ✅ Select project from dropdown
- ✅ When project selected: URL inputs greyed out

### For Users (Invited by Admins)
- ✅ Receive invitation email
- ✅ Set password
- ✅ See assigned projects only
- ✅ Select project to work on
- ✅ Only access enabled modules
- ✅ See "Module Deactivated" for disabled modules

### Analysis History Privacy
- ✅ Each user sees ONLY their own scans
- ✅ Old history cleared for privacy
- ✅ Filtered by user_id in backend

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Superadmin sees everything
- ✅ Admins see their projects only
- ✅ Users see assigned projects only
- ✅ Module permissions enforced

### User Activation
- ✅ New registrations pending approval
- ✅ Superadmin must activate
- ✅ Deactivated users can't login
- ✅ Deactivating admin deactivates all their users

### Audit Trail
- ✅ `user_activation_log` table
- ✅ Tracks who activated/deactivated whom
- ✅ Includes reason for deactivation

## 📞 Next Steps

**Your Action Required:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the migration SQL
3. Tell me "done" or "ready"

**My Action:**
1. Implement all 15 pending tasks
2. Test everything
3. Deploy to Railway/Vercel
4. You test with real users!

## 🚀 Ready to Continue!

As soon as you run the migration and confirm, I'll implement the entire system in one go!

**Estimated completion: ~3 hours after migration**
